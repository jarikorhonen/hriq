# High Resolution Image Quality (HRIQ) database and model

## The database
The resolutions of the images used for currently available large scale natural image quality databases tend to be relatively low. To bridge this gap, we present High Resolution Image Quality (HRIQ) database with 1,200 images with natural distortions, such as sensor noise, motion blur, and focus blur. The images have been rated by 175 test persons (about 25 ratings per image) in a laboratory environment.

The database and the related metadata with Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) are available for download [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TUaAD0pQMZjJInDpWd_apYXh3kDF6ydA). We have included three different resolution versions of each image in the dataset: 2880x2160, 1024x768, and 512x384; however, note that only the largest resolution was used in subjective testing. We will add a link to the paper with more details about the database here later.
